# Sakynasty Status (SakyStatus)

## ðŸš§ Important notice

Of course, **the project was never designed to be used by anyone other than myself**, and probably never will be. You'll have to make some modifications to the code if you intend to use my work as a basis.

Everyone has the right to use the code of the repo "SakyStatus" by [@Sakynasty](https://github.com/sakynasty) nevertheless all quotations of the code and original design must remain effective by respect of the working hours on the site which you avoid thanks to that.

The design was inspired by the "[Upptime](https://upptime.js.org/?ref=status.sakynasty.com)" Status pages, but was reworked using Tailwind, Flowbit and vanilla CSS.

The API is that of [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/?rid=c0a0c47070eff7), which I have customized myself under the [SakyAPI](https://api.sakynasty.com/api/uptimerobot/monitors?ref=status.sakynasty.com) service to improve it and add elements that are personally useful to me for [SakyStatus](https://status.sakynasty.com).
